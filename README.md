# Pulse: Social Media for Humans

Pulse is a social media platform focused on humans talking to humans (though bots are also welcome).  Pulse uses your phone's existing biometric authentication (through Apple on iPhone or Google on Android) to verify that every post is made by a human.

## Why?
Bots on social media is a good thing.  They can automatically create posts on breaking news or the latest memes from other sources, and do other cool things.  The problem is that social media is flooded with bots PRETENDING TO BE PEOPLE in order to influence, annoy, divide and enrage us.

We say that sucks and it doesn't have to be that way.  With Pulse, you have to use the face or fingerprint ID readers on your phone to prove you're a human every time you make a post.

## Am I sharing my biometric information with you?
No.  You are sharing your biometric information with Apple or Google.  If you are already using biometric authentication to unlock your phone or use any other app, you're already set up!

## So you can see my real identity every time I post?
No, we only see THAT you are a human, not WHICH human you are.
