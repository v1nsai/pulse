# Pulse: Social Media for Humans
Pulse is a social media platform focused on humans talking to humans (though bots are also welcome).  Pulse uses your phone's existing biometric authentication (through Apple on iPhone or Google on Android) to verify that every post is made by a human.

## Why?
Bots on social media is a good thing.  They can automatically create posts on breaking news or the latest memes from other sources, and do other cool things.  The problem is that social media is flooded with bots PRETENDING TO BE PEOPLE in order to influence, annoy, divide and enrage us.

We say that sucks and it doesn't have to be that way.  With Pulse, you have to use the face or fingerprint ID readers on your phone to prove you're a human every time you make a post.  Bot campaigns to influence opinions become much more difficult and expensive

## Am I sharing my biometric information with you?
No.  You are sharing your biometric information with Apple or Google.  If you are already using biometric authentication to unlock your phone or use any other app, you're already set up!  All you are allowing our app is permission to use that existing authentication.

## Am I sharing my real identity with you?
No, we only see THAT you are a human, not WHICH human you are when you authenticate to post.  You may have shared that information with Apple or Google, but we aren't requesting it and they aren't sharing it with us.

## How do you deal with bot farms that will have a human sitting in front of 50 phones making posts?
We can't really, but this is still significantly more difficult than running bot farms on Reddit or Twitter or Bluesky or any of the others.
